# net-critique
Webpage that gives a short but meaningful insight about ratings and reviews in a cross platform
environment. This includes the statistical ratings of IMDb, rotten tomatoes and selected reviews
from these sources. In the era where fake news and hoax media gets viral, its drastically hard to
distinguish something vague, so Net-Critique gives the users meaningful and true idea about
specific movies or TV shows making them statistically and conceptually sound.
